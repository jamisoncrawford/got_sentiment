# Game of Thrones Dialogue Analysis

## Overview

This work organizes and analyzes dialogue across seven seasons of the hit HBO series, [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), based on the book series, [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) by [George R. R. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin).

## Methods

For each season and sentence of dialogue, this analysis will use the [Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) to determine appropriate grade level and ease of reading - an appropriate proxy as each line of dialogue was first written, either by Martin himself, or adapted by showrunners [David Benioff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff) and [D. B. Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Weiss). Portions of dialogue and events directly adapted from the book series are distinguished from content created by Benioff and Weiss using content outlines from Martin's unfinished work, which may be seen in the [adaptation schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#Adaptation_schedule_and_episodes).

## Data Sources

Data were retrieved from Kaggle's [Game of Thrones Subtitles](https://www.kaggle.com/gunnvant/game-of-thrones-srt) dataset and are available in JSON format. Documentation describes the dataset as "every line from every season" (Saini, Gunnvant 2018).

Notably, the raw data are not provided in the correct order, but are still organized by episode and season (ibid.).
